Configs in the hpg directory can serve as a template for what to add to a specific Earth model's default configs.

Config files in the cesm directory can deploy to cesm2.1 and clm5.0 Earth models.

Configs in the ctsm directory should deploy to the corresponding ctsm Earth model.

If you want to install E3SM or cesm2.2 make another config directory and modify the update/verify scripts as needed.
